Hi, I am Carolina! I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University. I am based in the Cornell Tech campus in NYC, where I am advised by [Tom Ristenpart](https://rist.tech.cornell.edu/). Broadly speaking, I am interested in applied cryptography, security, and privacy.

I was previously at MIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Nathan Burow](https://www.ll.mit.edu/biographies/nathan-h-burow), [Howie Shrobe](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hes/index.html), and [Hamed Okhravi](https://web.mit.edu/ha22286/www/index.html).

**Note:** I will be organizing the [Cornell Security Seminar](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/secdg/) this fall (2023). Please contact me if you are interested in presenting.
